# 🍽️ Restaurant System (Java / NetBeans)

This is a restaurant management system built in **Java (NetBeans)** following the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture.  
It was developed in 2021 as a project to demonstrate system management, user roles, and communication between staff members.

---

## 📌 Description
The system grants access to three types of users:

- **Admin**
  - Manage the menu (add/edit meals).
  - Add waiters and chiefs.
  - Set salaries for staff.

- **Waiter**
  - Has personal login information.
  - Can send customer orders directly to the chief.

- **Chief (Chef)**
  - Has personal login information.
  - Receives and reviews orders from waiters.
  - Can approve or decline orders.

This system improves communication between waiters and the chief while giving the admin full control over staff and menu management.
